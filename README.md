## Outside of work
Growing up, I played baseball competitively at a high level. Playing baseball took me all across the world, I played in France, the USA, Australia, the Netherlands, and all across Europe for international tournaments. As I was embracing my engineering and management career, I stayed involved in the baseball community and started coaching mostly youth teams (kids aged from 9 to 17-18). We won regional and national titles with these teams, and some of the kids there reached their national teams. Even though my career is now in Technology, I have been managing and coaching teams for a long time.
